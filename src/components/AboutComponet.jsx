                    Hi! I'm Dinabandhu Barai, a passionate and curious Computer Science & Engineering student, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I enjoy building intelligent systems, crafting efficient web applications, and solving real-world problems through technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From working on machine learning models to designing responsive front-end interfaces, I love exploring how code can shape the future. I'm particularly interested in AI applications in environmental safety, finance, and historical linguistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on challenges that push my limits. Outside of coding, you might find me writing, cooking with friends, or exploring new music.
                </p>
